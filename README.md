This repository shares schematic, PCB, and source code templates that can be helpful for development using STM32 micro-controllers.

Currently, there are a lot different development board for STM32 MCU. However, each such a board represents only one micro-controller, and almost all these boards are not suitable for breadboards.

This project tries to address this problem and provides small, universal, and breadboards-friendly adapter and development board for wide range of STM32 controllers. This is possible since STM32 MCUâ€™s have really good compatibility to each other.

The directory **pcb** contains schematic and board layout developed in Eagle CAD. The final boards look like this:

In the directory **images**, you can find some photos of assembled boards like this one:
