This repository shares schematic, PCB, and source code templates that can be helpful for development using STM32 micro-controllers.

Currently, there are a lot different development board for STM32 MCU. However, each such a board represents only one micro-controller, and almost all these boards are not suitable for breadboards.

This project tries to address this problem and provides small, universal, and breadboards-friendly adapter and development board for wide range of STM32 controllers. This is possible since STM32 MCUâ€™s have really good compatibility to each other.

## Schematic and board layout
The directory **pcb** contains schematic and board layout developed in Eagle CAD:
- The adapter boards are just one-side breadboard adapters for LQFP32/48/64 IC's:

- The developments boards are two-side breadboard adapters for LQFP32/48/64 IC's, equipent with adaptable power supply circuit, HSE and LSE crystal circuit, reset button, and a **custom** 10-pin JTAG connector. SMD size for passive components is 0805. The adapter between 20-pin JTAG and this custom connector is also included in the set:

The final boards look like this:

In the directory **images**, you can find some photos of assembled boards like this one:

## Test

The directory **src** contains test examples developed in [System Workbench for STM32](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/sw4stm32.html). These test programms are based on HAL library and the second object-oriented abstraction layer called *StmPlusPlus*. Currently, following chips are tested: STM32F303K8Tx, STM32F303RBTx, STM32F373CBTx, STM32F373CCTx, STM32F410RBTx.
